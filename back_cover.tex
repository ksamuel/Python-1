When Python 2 End of Line was announced, the step by step migration guide the community followed looked a lot like:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Denial
\item Anger
\item Bargaining
\item Depression
\item Acceptance
\end{enumerate}

This book is about all the steps after that. We'll supposed you decided what to do now, and we will provide you with the help to do it:

\begin{itemize}
\item Some advices on which Python versions to choose, the one to port from, and the one to port to. Or not port to.

\item An in depth description of the differences between Python 2 and 3. And since we know the code you work on may not be your own, it will come with details on what all this stuff does, why it changed, and what are the consequences.

\item Solutions to stay on Python 2 for the decade to come. Yes, it's possible. Nobody told you ?

\item A migration strategy to either  move your project to something that works in Python 2 and 3, or just Python 3. Or both.

\item Tooling to support and even automatize the process as much as we can. Because we are coders after all.

\item And along the way, some nice, long and cristal clear explanations on complicated topics like encoding or object oriented programming.
\end{itemize}

In fact, weither you migrate your code or not, you'll be a better Python programmer after reading this book.
