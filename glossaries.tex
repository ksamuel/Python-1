    description={A callable in Python is anything you can call, meaning you can use \lstinline{()} right after the name to get an effect. Any object with the \lstinline{__call__()} method is considered a callable, but on the day to day job, the callables you will meet are mostly functions (e.g: \lstinline{len} is a callable) or classes (e.g: \lstinline{OrderedDict} from the \lstinline{collections} module is a callable).}
