Finally, we get to the point!

If you jumped to this chapter, remember we assume you perfectly undertstand what was in the previous one. Most people don't, so you may want to read it.

\section{Code file encoding}

First, you should make sure you use the best practices in your Python 2 code before moving to Python 3. To do so, ensure you know the encoding of all the code files in your project. Ideally, it should be UTF-8.

Then, add a special comment to all your files to tell Python you are using this encoding. It should be the first or second line of each file, and formatted that way: \lstinline{# coding: <encoding name>}. E.G:

\begin{py2and3}
# coding: utf-8
\end{py2and3}

You may see in tutorials fancy headers like \lstinline{# -*- coding: <encoding> -*-}. There is not need for the \lstinline{-*-}, it's an artefact that people keep copy/pasting blindly and has only a benefit if you use Emacs.

Without this line, Python 2 default to ASCII, which leads to a crash if you use any non ASCII characters in your code, even in commens. In Python 3, Python default to UTF-8.

The, you need to avoid using \lstinline{bytes()} has much as possible. In Python 2, when you create a string, it's like a \lstinline{bytes()}. But if you create a string with a \lstinline{u} prefix, it will create a \lstinline{unicode()}, which behaves like the Python 3 text type.

So instead of doing:

\begin{py2}
>>> msg = "This is a string"
>>> type(msg)
<type 'str'>
\end{py2}

Do:

\begin{py2}
>>> msg = u"This is a string" # note the u prefix
>>> type(msg)
<type 'unicode'>
\end{py2}

The \lstinline{u} prefix does nothing in Python 3, a regular \lstinline{str()} will be created. But it's ok since they behave like \lstinline{unicode()}.

However, this is very combersom. Instead, do:

\begin{py2}
from __future__ import unicode_literals
\end{py2}

It will make all string literals create a \lstinline{unicode}:

\begin{py2}
>>> msg = "This is a string"
>>> type(msg)
<type 'unicode'>
\end{py2}

Again, this does nothing in Python 3, which is what we want.

Unfortunatly, we don't want to turn all \lstinline{str()} to \lstinline{unicode()}.

We do want to convert all strings meant to be readable by a human: help text, user messages, labels, etc.

But we do \textbf{not} want to convert bytes (mistakenly stored in a \lstinline{str()} in Python 2): network packets, pickled objects, dumps from the \lstinline{struct} module, file paths, anything to be written in a file in \lstinline{b} mode, etc.

So you need to go through your files, and find those. Then mark them as \lstinline{bytes()}, by putting a \lstinline{b} in front of them.

\begin{py2}
>>> msg = b"This is a string"
>>> type(msg)
<type 'str'>
\end{py2}

In Python 2, this will keep it as a \lstinline{str()}. In Python 3, it will make it a \lstinline{bytes()}. Again, this is what we want.

Be careful though, indexing or iterating through a \lstinline{str()} in Python 2 gives you \lstinline{str()}:

\begin{py2}
>>> list(b'qwerty')
['q', 'w', 'e', 'r', 't', 'y']
\end{py2}

But indexing or iterating through a \lstinline{bytes()} in Python 3 will give you \lstinline{int()}:

\begin{py2}
>>> list(b'qwerty')
[113, 119, 101, 114, 116, 121]
\end{py2}

It's a rare use case, but if you happen to do that, either \lstinline(.decode()) the bytes to get a \lstinline{unicode()} in Python 2 and a \lstinline{str()} in Python 3, which will give you letters. Or call \lstinline{bytearray()} on the bytes to ensure numbers everywhere.

Then, there is the matter of text files.

%__future__

u

decode

encode

codecs.open() (and perfs)

formatting bytes

always call open() with an encoding or else

buffer. Par exemple, pour écrire des octets sur stdout, utilisez sys.stdout.buffer.write(b'abc').

unfortunately, changing sys.stdout to accept only unicode breaks a lot of libraries that expect it to accept encoded bytestrings. – nosklo Dec 4 '09 at 19:14

Text strings in Python 3 require either 2x as much memory to store as Python 2


bad filenames were easy to create in python 2

If you ever see a \lstinline{\udcxx} character, it means that a non-decodable byte was passed in from a system interface

s.decode('utf-8','surrogateescape')

TextIOWrapper 10 times faster than codecs.open

basestring

%All backslashes in raw string literals are interpreted literally. This means that '\U' and '\u' escapes in raw strings are not treated specially. For example, r'\u20ac' is a string of 6 characters in Python 3.0, whereas in 2.6, ur'\u20ac' was the single “euro” character. (Of course, this change only affects raw string literals; the euro character is '\u20ac' in Python 3.0.)

% has been removed and reinstroduced

pathlib

%# coding: utf8

\section{file()}

\begin{py2}
from io import IOBase

if isinstance(someobj, IOBase):
\end{py2}

\section{from buffer() tp memoryview()}

Those two functions respectively create objects of the same name - a \lstinline{buffer} and a \lstinline{memoryview}. Both are a way to get a subset of something without copying it:

\begin{py2}
>>> donkey_lines = "Are we there yet ?\n" * 10000
>>> # this copies the data into a new object:
>>> for x in donkey_lines[:6]:
...    print(x)
A
r
e

w
e
>>> # those don't:
>>> for x in buffer(donkey_lines, 0, 5):
...    print(x)
A
r
e

w
e
>>> for x in memoryview(donkey_lines)[:5]:
...    print(x)
A
r
e

w
e
\end{py2}

It works on \lstinline{bytes()}, \lstinline{bytearray}, \lstinline{array.array}...Everything that implements the so-called \textquote{buffer protocol}. This is a very nice optimization that can save quite a lot of memory/CPU if you manipulate huge chunks of bytes and pass around subset of them, e.g: to files or sockets.

With the rise of performant c libs wrapped in Python (numpy, GUI toolkits, database drivers, etc.), the need for more information about the underlying data than what \lstinline{buffer()} was offering became important. \lstinline{memoryview} provides an answer to that, being able to return the shape, dimension or type or the object behind it.

\lstinline{buffer()} is not more in Python 3, just replace it with \lstinline{memoryview()}. The later exists in Python 2.7, plus it does the same thing, just better. The only difficulty will be that \lstinline{buffer()} accepts \lstinline{unicode()} objects but \lstinline{memoryview()} only accept bytes, and so you'll need to encode them.

So:

\begin{py2}
from imaginary_lib import get_tps_reports, send_those_bytes

# Imaginary code returning a lot of bytes
tps_reports = get_tps_reports()

# Imaginary code writting those bytes to a sockets by chunks
# of 1Mio
step = 3
stop = len(tps_reports)
for i in range(0, stop, step):
    send_those_bytes(buffer(tps_reports, i, step))

\end{py2}
