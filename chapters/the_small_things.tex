80\% of porting your Python 2 code to Python 3 will be about little details. Thankfully, we'll see later than it can be mostly automated.

\section{print}

You probably already know this, \lstinline{print} used to be a keyword, and is now a function.

For simple display, this mean we go from this:

\begin{py}
print "Howdy, Earth!"
\end{py}


To:

\begin{py}
print("Howdy, Earth!")
\end{py}

And since \lstinline{print} \href{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0214/}{does fancy things}:

\begin{py}
with open('out.log', 'w') as f:
    print >>f, "This redirects to a log file"
print "Ending with a coma skips the line break",
\end{py}

You may have to use:

\begin{py}
with open('out.log', 'w') as f:
    print("This redirects to a log file", file=f)
print("Ending with a coma skips the line break", end="")
\end{py}

Starting from Python 2.7, you can turn on the Python 3 behavior using:

\begin{py}
from __future__ import print_function
\end{py}

At the begining of a file. It will be limited to that file and needs to be repeated.

I advice you to do this as early has possible, espacially since the muscle memory from typing the old syntax of \lstinline{print} is probably what will take you the most time to port! Besides, the function version has some additional nice features (see the chapter \textquote{New features to take advantage of}).

If you really don't want to do change all your prints yet, and don't want to use \lstinline{__future__} in every file, you can define:

\begin{py}
printf = getattr(__builtins__, 'print')
print("Look Ma, print() function without __future__!")
\end{py}

But really, \lstinline{__future__} is your friend.

\section{Dictionaries}

To iterate on keys, values or key/value pairs, you need to use special methods in Python:

\begin{py}
>>> population = {
...     "Octopod": 2 - 1,
...     "Xenomorph": "too many",
...     "Goa'uld": 0,
...     "Wookie": "no enough" ,
...     "Andalite": 2,
...     "Mondoshawan": "?",
... }
>>>
>>> print(population.keys())
... print(population.values())
... print(population.keys())
...
['Wookie', "Goa'uld", 'Octopod', 'Xenomorph', 'Andalite', 'Mondoshawan']
['no enough', 0, 1, 'too many', 2, '?']
['Wookie', "Goa'uld", 'Octopod', 'Xenomorph', 'Andalite', 'Mondoshawan']
\end{py}

Because those methods produce lists, an operation that consume a lot of memory and CPU for a simple iteration, alternatives were provided.

The \lstinline{iter*} methods return a generator, sparing the need to allocate arrays:

\begin{py}
>>> print(population.iterkeys())
... print(population.itervalues())
... print(population.iterkeys())
<dictionary-keyiterator object at 0x7f56340a0628>
<dictionary-valueiterator object at 0x7f56340a0628>
<dictionary-keyiterator object at 0x7f56340a0628>
\end{py}

They are iterable as well, so you can use a \lstinline{for} loop on them just like with lists, but but they can only be read once:

\begin{py}
>>> names = population.iterkeys()
>>> list(names)
['Wookie', "Goa'uld", 'Octopod', 'Xenomorph', 'Andalite', 'Mondoshawan']
>>> list(names)
[]
\end{py}

A better solution was found using memory views:

\begin{py}
>>> print(population.viewitems())
... print(population.viewvalues())
... print(population.viewkeys())
dict_items([('Wookie', 'no enough'), ("Goa'uld", 0), ('Octopod', 1), ('Xenomorph', 'too many'), ('Andalite', 2), ('Mondoshawan', '?')])
dict_values(['no enough', 0, 1, 'too many', 2, '?'])
dict_keys(['Wookie', "Goa'uld", 'Octopod', 'Xenomorph', 'Andalite', 'Mondoshawan'])

\end{py}

They save the same amount of resources, but can be read multiple times.

However, in Python 3:

\begin{list}
\item \lstinline{iter*} and \lstinline{view*} methods have been removed
\item \lstinline{keys()}, \lstinline{values()} and \lstinline{items()} now return memory views.
\end{list}

So when you migrate, you want to replace all \lstinline{iter*} and \lstinline{view*} methods by regular \lstinline{keys()}, \lstinline{values()} and \lstinline{items()}. Obviously, if your code will run both in Python 2 and 3 for a while, the Python 2 code will become less performant. You can create a function to avoid this:

\begin{py}
import sys

if sys.version_info.major < 3:
    def dict_items(d):
        return d.viewitems()
else:
    def dict_items(d):
        return d.items()
\end{py}

And use that instead of calling the methods directly.

But don't be too hasty to do this, as in the second part of the book we will see some lirbaries that already offer those kind of tools.

One other gotcha : memory views cannot be used exactly like lists. E.G: you cannot index them (\lstnewenvironment{population.viewitems()}[0] won't work), use \lstinline{append()} on them or add them to another list.

If your code need to do that, convert them to lists before:

\begin{py}
stats = list(population.viewitems())
\end{py}

\section{Operations}

Coders doing a lot of maths will quickly notice de division operator has changed.

Where in Python 2 you used to do:

\begin{py}
>>> 4 / 3
1
>>> float(4) / 3  # or you may see operator.truediv(4, 3)
1.3333333333333333
\end{py}

In Python 3, the default division results in a float:

\begin{py}
>>> 4 / 3
1.3333333333333333
>>> 4 // 3  # if you want the old behavior, use this new operator
\end{py}

Now it's a trap because \lstinline{4 // 3} is valid Python 2, but it's doesn't do the same thing:

\begin{py}
>>> 4 // 3
1
\end{py}

Fortunatly, you can activate the behavior of Python 3 in Python 2 by adding at the top of each file:

\begin{py}
from __future__ import division
\end{py}

Like with \lstinline{print()}, I advise you to do this as early as possible.

Along with this change, Python 2 removed two things that I doubt you will miss but it's always good to mention.

\begin{list}
    \item The \lstinline{<>} operator. It was exactly like \lstinline{!=}. Just do a search and replace for this, really.
    \item The \lstinline{long} number type. When you created a big integer, Python turned it into a new type which was neither \lstinline{int} nor \lstinline{float}, and appeared suffixed with an L in the terminal (e.g: 9999999999999999999L). This is an implementation detail and you should not worry about it unless you used to parse it manually, in which case, do it in a condition.
\end{list}


\section{Builtins}

Builtins are callables, mostly functions, that are available without import. e.g: \lstinline{print()} and \lstinline{len()} are builtins.

reduce
xrange
map
filter

\section{Syntax}

True = False
Exception
